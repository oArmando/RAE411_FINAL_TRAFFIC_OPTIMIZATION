# RAE411_FINAL_TRAFFIC_OPTIMIZATION

Project consists of Weka model in different circumstances:
  1. Case when all data is considered in model 
  2. Case of HOME model, which consists only of data, which can be measured in home conditions
  
Corresponding PNG files of each model are meant for vizualizng model, and possible implementing of clause sensitive programming.


heart.arff file is data which is used in this project


In react-SurveyJS blank branch it is possible to get blank file for future surveyJs implementation

Example for fast checking final model: https://surveyjs.io/published?id=099a1255-a555-4793-9307-600149113e4a

In SurveyJS-React Final branch we have working final version of SurveyJs-React app on localhost

Go inside health folder and type npx start

configurable react file is in /healt/src/App.js

This project was made to make hearth disease prediction software based on BIG data and WEKA machine learning data analysis as in todays environment, where doctors appointments is often forbiden, you need to have some remote software for checking.

What project does:
1. Utilizes WEKA to analize data
2. Uses REACT and SurveyJS to make testing app

This project is based on WEKA, REACT and SurveyJS

Proposed architecture is to use BIG data to make WEKA model and tree, which is implemented in REACT-SURVEYJS app.

Chalenges i run into:
1. A lot of data makes very big trees, which is hard to imlement in application, so we need to filter input data to reduce size and make it more workable
2.Clause programming in react is nightmare, so even 3 branch tree takes lot of time to implement

I am proud of making model with 80% precision in certain age dimension. I am not proud of implementing small tree and not finished project to work as i wished

What i learned: I learned how to implement WEKA machine model in app and learned such good ML tool as WEKA. Also i learned React, SurveyJS, JQuery and also other things that we learned during course.

Whats next. Completeing project as maybe project as it is isn't very useful, but it is good skeleton for different projects, that can be very useful in life.
